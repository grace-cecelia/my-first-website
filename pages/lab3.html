                <p>Partner: Vicky
                    <br></br>
                    Vicky's storyboards were more visually based with less accompanying text. I focused on describing
                    each action in sequence within one panel, with up to 6 or 7 actions per panel. Most of Vicky's
                    panels contained only one action and one player interaction, leading to a cleaner sequence. Despite
                    these differences, we used similar techniques for showing motion and camera actions.
                    <br></br>
                    I think Vicky's integration of player interactions was simpler and more elegant than mine. I'm not
                    sure it was necessary for me to include every single stepwise action and interaction, and I could
                    have combined some of the steps into one. Vicky's storyboards are cleaner and simpler to read than
                    mine, even though they have less detail overall.
                    <br></br>

            <div class="learning-section">
                <h3>Linear vs. non-linear</h3>
                <p>This exercise showed me the complexity of storyboarding for non-linear media. Storyboards for any
                    project can be complex, with many elements to consider and work out, but non-linear media involves
                    the extra element of user actions. I think a big challenge I faced was not just depicting this
                    gameplay sequence as if it were an animation and instead thinking about how to connect the player's
                    actions with the actions occurring in the game.
                    <br></br>
                    I used many of the same techniques for these storyboards that I've used to storyboard animations in
                    the past, as the visual language for both animations and interactive media can have a lot of
                    overlap. However, while animations traditionally play independently of audience interactions, the
                    driving force behind non-linear media like games is the user's actions. This means that there are
                    many more possibilities within non-linear media that need to be considered, and there are many more
                    design choices we have to make to ensure that our audience's needs are met. While audience members
                    can passively watch an animation and absorb the information it contains, gaining that same
                    information in an interactive format requires a design that facilitates specific types, orders, and
                    levels of interaction.
